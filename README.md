# SADLN

## Introduction

 SADLN: a self-attention based deep learning network integrating multi-omics data for cancer subtype recognition. SADLN is a middle integration method by consolidates the adversarial generation network and the self-attention mechanism to describe the different distributions of multi-omics data and fusion samplesâ€™ relationship. It used an independent sub network to learn omics-specific features and concatenated omics-specific features to an integration representation. Then used a self-attention to learn the relationship of samples on the integration representation and obtained a feature representation that fused the sample relationship. Finally, it used the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to obtain the subtyping label of each sample.

~~~python
# the input list of BRCA omics data set is input.txt. We can use the following command to finish the subtyping process: 
python SADLN.py -m SADLN -t BRCA -i ./input/BRCA.list

## Requirements

~~~python
# It is recommended to use the conda command to configure the environment:

SADLN is based on the Python program language. The generative adversarial network's implementation was based on the open-source library scikit-learn 0.22, Keras 2.2.4, and Tensorflow 1.14.0 .
